Hello everyone, its finally time to recollect all the knowledge of the previous 5 weeks and implement it to a real case scenario.<br> 
We initially planned to implement a research paper focusing on solving a major issue in RL in self driving cars, but due to time constraints and also since everyone don't have access to PCs which can run heavy simulators, we will be using the Highway-env simulator and try to implement our RL algorithms in the Highway mode.<br> 
But, we have attached a research paper based on PPO-DRL, it explains most of what we have covered pretty nicely and you can definitely take ideas and motivation from that paper.
