Hello everyone!
It's finally time to bring together everything we've learned over the past five weeks and apply it to a real-world scenario.

Our initial plan was to implement a research paper tackling a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for self-driving cars. However, due to time constraints and the fact that not everyone has access to high-performance PCs capable of running heavy simulators—we’ve decided to shift our focus.

Instead, we’ll be using the Highway-env simulator and applying our RL algorithms in Highway mode, which is lightweight and accessible for everyone.

To help guide you, we’ve attached a research paper based on PPO-DRL. It covers many of the concepts we’ve explored and can serve as a solid reference. Feel free to draw ideas and motivation from it as you work on your implementation.
