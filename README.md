# RL_in_SelfDrivingCars_SOC25

### Plan of Action (Tentative): <br/>
Week 1: Covering Basic concepts of RL <br/>
Week 2: Moving to well-known RL algorithms <br/>
Week 3: Coding assignment to check the progress <br/>
Week 4: Learning about vehicle dynamics, implementing some basic control algorithms <br/>
Week 5: Coding assignment on control algorithm <br/>
Week 6: Reading the final paper that we will follow <br/>
Week 7: Implementing the paper <br/>
Week 8: Testing and tuning on the simulator <br/>

### Major Checkpoints: <br/>
Checkpoint 1: First coding assignment <br/> 
Checkpoint 2: Second Coding assignment <br/>
Checkpoint 3: Mid-project report <br/>
Checkpoint 4: Final Coding assignment <br/>
Checkpoint 5: Final report submission

### Progress
Week 1: I went throught the materials given, like OpenAI SpinningUp and lecture series by David Silver <br/>
Week 2: Studied various RL algos like SAC, PPO, DDPG, Q-learning, MPC, etc.
Week 3: Implemented the RL algos from scratch
Week 4: Studied the basics of vehicle dynamics and vehicular models like kinematic bicycle model, dynamic bicycle model, etc.
Week 5: Implemented the kinematic bicycle model with PID controller
