# RL_in_SelfDrivingCars_SOC25

Plan of Action (Tentative):
Week 1: Covering Basic concepts of RL
Week 2: Moving to well-known RL algorithms 
Week 3: Coding assignment to check the progress
Week 4: Learning about vehicle dynamics, implementing some basic control algorithms
Week 5: Coding assignment on control algorithm
Week 6: Reading the final paper that we will follow
Week 7: Implementing the paper 
Week 8: Testing and tuning on simulator
