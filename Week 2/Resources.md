For the second week lets move to going into depth of some well-known RL algorithms:
1. Q-learning, Monte-Carlo
2. Deep Q-Network
3. PPO
4. DDPG
5. SAC
# Resources:
# Deliverables: A brief report on the above methods, as per your understanding. Also, explain all the new vocabulary used in these algorithms nicely which you must have learned in your first week
