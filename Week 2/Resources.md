For the second week lets dive deep into some well-known RL algorithms:
1. Q-learning, Monte-Carlo
2. PPO
3. DDPG
4. SAC
5. Deep Q-Network (optional)
# Resources: <br> 
1. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html# (for 2-4)
2. For Q-learning, Monte-Carlo: GeeksforGeeks is enough 
3. Explore and Exploit: Youtube, AI, David Silver's lecture, Sutton and Barto are your friends
# Deliverables: <br> 
A brief report on the above methods, as per your understanding. Also, explain all the new vocabulary used in these algorithms nicely which you must have learned in your first week
# Important Note:<br>
Try to setup the dependencies required for Spinning up, as it will be important for the tasks of week 3. Also, start exploring the library along with OpenAI Gym.
