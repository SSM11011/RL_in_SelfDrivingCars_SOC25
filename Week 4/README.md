Hello everyone,

Firstly, congratulations to each of you on successfully completing Phase 1 of our project!

I completely understand if it felt overwhelming at times—especially the coding assignment. But believe me when I say this: you are now among the very few students who have not only worked on reinforcement learning (RL) projects but have also implemented advanced algorithms like PPO, SAC, and DDPG from scratch.

While in most real-world projects you'll typically import these algorithms from libraries, going through the process of building them from the ground up is a rare and valuable learning experience. It gives you a deeper internal understanding of how these methods actually work—something that will give you an edge during internship season and technical interviews.

Beyond that, having this kind of unique and rigorous work on your resume truly sets you apart. I hope Phase 1 was a rewarding experience and that the skills you've developed will continue to support your journey ahead.

Great work, and let’s keep the momentum going!

So for our next step, lets start by learing a bit about the final environment that we are working towards- CARS!
