1. Lectures by David Silver: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-&si=f71naScldk1Mbfwi <br/>
2.  If you are interested in a much more mathematical dive into RL, then I highly recommend CS747 lectures: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs747-s2025/index.html <br/>
You can find these lectures on CDEEP as well. <br/>
Note: These lectures are divided into 3 sections. We don't need the first section (MABs). The second section is MDPs, and the third section is RL. Having a basic idea of the topics covered in section 2 is essential to cover section.
