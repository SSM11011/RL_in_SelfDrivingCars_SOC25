1. OpenAI Spinning Up: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html (Complete all three Parts of the "Introduction to RL" module)
2. Lectures by David Silver: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-&si=f71naScldk1Mbfwi <br/> (Complete all the lectures in the first 2 weeks)
3.  If you are interested in a much more mathematical dive into RL, then I highly recommend CS747 lectures: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs747-s2025/index.html <br/>
You can find these lectures on CDEEP as well. <br/>
Note: These lectures are divided into 3 sections. We don't need the first section (MABs). The second section is MDPs, and the third section is RL. Having a basic idea of the topics covered in section 2 is essential to cover section 3. (You can discuss with me if you want to learn RL this way)
4. Sutton and Barto (Classic RL textbook): http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf (For later stages)
